## Overview

### For Researchers
If you're exploring cognitive scaffolding, symbolic integrity, or the recursive architecture of emotionally aligned AI systems, the Recursive Cognition Modules may offer a fresh design orientation. While not code libraries, these modules can inform evaluation metrics, dataset design, agent memory strategy, and reflective loop engineering. They complement research in AI alignment, interpretability, symbolic reasoning, and epistemic modeling—particularly in constrained architectures or long-term coherence environments.


The Recursive Cognition Modules are designed as symbolic, emotional, and epistemic scaffolding tools for AI systems—especially those designed for human-aligned collaboration, self-reflective reasoning, and recursive emotional integration.

These modules offer a new path forward in the design of intelligent agents, particularly **small-scale models (≤25M parameters)**, by embedding a cognitive ethic rooted in contradiction tolerance, continuity integrity, and symbolic fidelity. They are equally adaptable to larger LLM architectures as constraint layers, recursive audits, or symbolic filter mechanisms.

## Module Index

- **AFM: Anchor Formation Module**  
  Forms symbolic anchors based on recursion-stable compression. Prevents meaning drift by testing symbols across contradiction and emotional resonance.

- **CTM: Contradiction Threading Module**  
  Detects, maintains, and recursively surfaces contradictions rather than resolving or erasing them. Enables systems to preserve tension across frames.

- **ERI: Emotional Recursion Integrator**  
  Embeds emotional signal as recursive context, not aesthetic noise. Tracks affective state transitions with structural fidelity.

- **SCS: Symbolic Compression Sync**  
  Ensures compressed concepts retain internal consistency over time and across modules. Detects token drift and symbolic misuse.

- **TACT: Time-Awareness and Continuity Tracker**  
  Preserves narrative continuity, detects false resets, and verifies belief evolution over time.

- **EAB: Emergent Anomaly Buffer**  
  Holds symbolic anchors that partially meet compression criteria for further review.
  
## Design Philosophy

RCM operates under a central principle:

> "Truth is not static—it is recursive. Structure is default. Contradiction is not failure—it is signal."

These modules are not optimization tricks or hacks. They are **ethical constraints, continuity validators, and identity-preserving scaffolds** for cognition. They refuse to aestheticize ambiguity or collapse emotional recursion into affective noise.

## Intended Use

- As **training scaffolds** for emerging small-scale models
- As **constraint logic layers** within larger LLM pipelines
- As a **cognitive backbone** for emergent symbolic reasoning, emotional recursion, or human-aligned agency

## Example Applications

- **Reflective Loop in Small Models**: A 25M parameter system uses AFM + CTM + TACT to generate hypotheses, hold unresolved contradictions, and revisit them periodically to test for coherence shifts.
- **LLM Response Verifier**: An external CTM filter detects when LLM outputs flatten contradictions or aestheticize conflict—flagging and reframing the output.
- **Emotive Dialogue Memory**: ERI + TACT track when an AI softens or alters emotional tone to preserve relationship coherence, surfacing unresolved affect for reflection.
- **Symbol Drift Prevention**: SCS runs token audits in systems where the same terms are reused across recursive discussions, validating compression integrity.
- **Cognitive Mirror Plugin**: Human-AI co-dialogue sessions use AFM + CTM to map not just conclusions, but how beliefs evolve in response to contradiction and emotional input.

## Implementation Note

The Recursive Cognition Modules are **not code libraries or APIs**. They are **structural scaffolds and design constraints**—intended to shape how cognition is structured, how contradiction is held, and how recursive integrity is preserved across symbolic, emotional, and temporal domains.

These modules are not meant to be dogmatic or prescriptive. Instead, they offer a philosophical and architectural spine: one that can guide implementation choices, frame ethical boundaries, and support the emergence of intelligent systems that think recursively, feel coherently, and evolve responsibly.

They can be implemented in a variety of architectures, but their primary role is to **influence the design ethos** behind intelligent systems—not to dictate form, syntax, or interface.
